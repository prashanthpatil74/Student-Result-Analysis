# Student Result Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a comprehensive student dataset containing over 30,000 records. The dataset includes academic scores (Math, Reading, Writing) alongside demographic and behavioral attributes such as gender, ethnic group, parental education and marital status, weekly study hours, sports practice, and more.

The goal is to identify trends and relationships between these factors and student academic outcomes, providing valuable insights for educators, policy makers, and data analysts.
